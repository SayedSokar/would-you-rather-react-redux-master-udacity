# Would You Rather
------------------
folder Name: would-you-rather-react-redux-master
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Introduction
--------------
This app is the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this:
one user is asked a question in the question form and provides 2 possible answers as options, for example: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. 
Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules. And there is a poll system that indicates the votes for the user.
